# MERN Stack Authentication (MongoDB, Express, React, Node)

# Overview 
I've been tasked by my mentor to research more into auth. I have started by doing some basic research, writing notes down in my good old fashioned notepad.
I will then build a small basic auth application using a tutorial or two. At time of writing I do not know the exact path of the tutorial although have a good idea.

# What I want to learn
- Sign up
- Sign in
- User Schemas
- Verifying emails and passwords
- hashing passwords
- setting up routes
- handling user data
- protecting routes
- JSON web tokens
- Making API calls to the backend
- handling user sessions
- adding specific roles for different users
- permissions

# Long term goal
I am currently building an educational game. So I would like to add auth into that so a user can save a score and when they come back beat that high score as an example. In this project I will implement a very simple game so I can practice saving a users score.
